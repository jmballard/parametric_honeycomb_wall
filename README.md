## Motivations <a name="motivations"></a>

After having printed everything I could for my Honeycomb storage wall, I realised that most of the already existing objects needed a slight adjustments that I was doing manually in Tinkercad. 

I decided to learn OpenSCAD to be able to make more fun objects in the future.

## Project description <a name="description"></a>

This repository will contain all my work on OpenSCAD for my parametric objects for the honeycomb storage wall. I will add at the bottom of this README file links of other peoples projects in OpenSCAD for the honeycomb storage wall.


## Visuals <a name="visuals"></a>

All projects will be posted on printables.com (Links TBC)

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

### Prerequisites

You need to have OpenSCAD in your machine, and the library BOSL2 (https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2?tab=readme-ov-file) for simplified OpenSCAD coding.

I'm using the library from https://www.printables.com/model/260073-openscad-library-for-hsw-attachments to add the attachments to the honeycomb wall.

Both libraries need to be installed in your OpenSCAD library directory for your platform.

## Files <a name="files"></a>

Here is the content of this repo:

```

## Possible improvements on this project: <a name="improvements"></a>

List of possible ideas:

- micro SD holder (with X SD slots)
- screwdriver holder (X screwdrivers, length, depth, etc)
- slim hooks
- thicker hooks
- triangular hook with isocele triangle (angle, length)
- round hook (radius int & width)

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

I couldn't have done this repository without the openSCAD library by "The Real Gareth Evans" above that I listed in the requirements. It helped me to create the inserts into the wall.
